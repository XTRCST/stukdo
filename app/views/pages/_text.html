<p>Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. the first mouse quickly gave up and drowned. the second mouse, wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse. what do you want me to say, that I'm sorry? that I apologize? well, people in hell want ice water, pal. I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you, with a minimum of fuss! money, jewels, a very big ball of string.</p>
